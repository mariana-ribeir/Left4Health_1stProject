# AnxietyDetect AI

## Description:
AnxietyDetect AI is an expert system that uses **Drools** and **Prolog** to diagnose anxiety disorders.  
The system implements a set of rules and logical reasoning on both platforms to ensure **accuracy** and **reliability** in the diagnostic process.

## Features:
- Rule-based reasoning in Drools  
- Logical inference with Prolog  
- Consistent and reliable anxiety disorder detection  
- Designed for educational and research purposes

## Technologies:
- **Drools**: Java-based rules engine  
- **Prolog**: Logic programming for inference  
- Java / Prolog integration  

## Purpose:
This project demonstrates the combination of **expert systems** and **logic programming** to address mental health diagnostics. It highlights my ability to implement cross-platform logic and reasoning systems.

## Development Blog:
